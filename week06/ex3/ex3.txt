Shortest Job first has the advantage of having a minimum average waiting time among all scheduling algorithms. 
It may cause starvation if shorter processes keep coming. This problem can be solved using the concept of ageing. 
FCFS is the simplest algorithm does not have any other advantages.

Round Robin - It is probably one of the best scheduling algorithms. The efficiency of this algorithm depends on the quantum value. 
It doesn't have the same speed as SFJ, but does not starve long processes. Round robin better than FCFS in almost all aspects.
