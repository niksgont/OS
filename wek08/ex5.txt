In computing, a physical address, is a memory address that is represented in the form of a binary number on the address bus circuitry in order to enable the data bus to access a particular storage cell of main memory, or a register of memory-mapped I/O device.
A virtual address is a binary number in virtual memory that enables a process to use a location in primary storage independently of other processes and to use more space than actually exists in primary storage by temporarily relegating some contents to a hard disk or internal flash drive.
Virtual addresses are typically larger than physical addresses.
It is the task of the operating system to map the virtual addresses to physical ones.
