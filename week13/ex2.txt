recovery
This method allows the processes to become stuck and then checks for deadlock in the system on a regular basis. If it does, the system then employs several recovery techniques to break the impasse.
prevention
Only when Mutual Exclusion, hold and wait, No Preemption, and circular wait all hold at the same time does deadlock occur. The system will never reach a stalemate if any one of the four conditions can be broken at any time.
avoidance
At each step the operating system takes in deadlock avoidance, it determines whether the system is in a safe state or an unsafe state. Up until the system is in a safe state, the procedure keeps going. The OS must take a step back whenever the system enters an unsafe condition.
